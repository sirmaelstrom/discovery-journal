# The Discovery Journal

> A guided self-examination tool for discovering your cognitive architecture. Browser-native, no backend, no account required. Free and open source.

The Discovery Journal walks you through five phases of structured self-observation. You examine seven cognitive systems — energy, attention, motivation, memory, learning, social processing, and environment — then extract patterns, identify failure modes, derive a personal doctrine, and align your systems to it.

The result is a Cognitive Architecture Document: a portable description of how your mind actually operates and what that means for every system, environment, and routine you interact with.

Built by Justin Heath. Takes about an hour, or spread across multiple sessions — progress saves automatically in your browser's localStorage.

## How It Works

- Phase 1 — Systems Mapping: Answer structured questions about seven cognitive systems to observe how you actually operate
- Phase 2 — Pattern Extraction: Cross-reference your observations to surface recurring themes with predictive power
- Phase 3 — Failure Mode Analysis: Identify how and where your systems break down under stress, boredom, or overload
- Phase 4 — Doctrine Derivation: Distill your patterns into a single governing principle and decision-making meta-rule
- Phase 5 — System Alignment: Apply your doctrine to evaluate and redesign your current tools, routines, and environments
