# Operator Discovery Toolkit — Voice Sample & Doctrine Examples

For Codex: use these to calibrate the tone of all user-facing copy in the app.

## Voice Sample — Landing Page Intro

Use this as the landing page explanatory text. This is written in the author's actual voice.

```
You use tools every day that were designed for someone else's brain.

Not maliciously. The people who built them just assumed everyone thinks the same way — that focus works like a spotlight, that motivation comes from checking boxes, that organization means hierarchy. For some people, that's exactly right. For others, it's a constant low-grade friction they've learned to blame on themselves.

This toolkit helps you stop guessing and start observing. You'll examine seven cognitive systems — how your energy actually moves, where your attention breaks, what sustains your motivation, how your memory really works. Not how you think they should work. How they do.

From those observations, you'll extract patterns with predictive power. Not labels like "I'm a visual learner" — predictions like "context-switching between unrelated domains costs me 30 minutes of recovery, which means my workspace needs to keep background projects visible."

Then you'll derive a single governing principle — a doctrine — that turns arbitrary design decisions into testable ones. Does this tool preserve my momentum or fragment it? Does this process respect my cognitive patterns or punish them?

You'll leave with a Cognitive Architecture Document: a clear, portable description of how your mind operates and what that means for every tool, workflow, and system you touch.

It takes about an hour. Or take it across multiple sessions — your progress saves automatically.

## Doctrine Examples

Three real examples. These show the range of what a doctrine can look like. Use them as inspiration copy, not templates.

### Example 1: Momentum-Driven System

> **Primary Directive:** Preserve and extend cognitive momentum.
>
> **Meta-Rule:** "Does this preserve or degrade cognitive momentum?"
>
> **Key Patterns:**
> - Runs on stimulation, not restoration — recharges by switching modes, not by stopping
> - Detects momentum, not completion — progress visibility matters more than task completion
> - Memory weakness manifests as restart penalty cost — fast context reconstruction is non-negotiable
>
> **What this meant in practice:** Task lists stopped being the organizing principle. Progress indicators replaced checkboxes. Background projects stayed visible instead of hidden. The system was redesigned around the question "can I resume in seconds?" instead of "is this organized?"

### Example 2: Precision-First System

> **Primary Directive:** Ensure understanding before action.
>
> **Meta-Rule:** "Can I explain why this is correct, not just that it works?"
>
> **Key Patterns:**
> - Learns by constructing mental models, not by doing — needs the "why" before the "how"
> - Tolerates slow starts but needs reliable depth — surface-level familiarity creates anxiety, not confidence
> - Trust is earned through demonstrated correctness, not speed
>
> **What this meant in practice:** AI tools became reviewers first, generators second. Code wasn't accepted until it could be explained. The workflow shifted from "generate and tweak" to "explain, then generate, then verify the explanation still holds." Slower to start, but fewer reversals.

### Example 3: Relational-Contextual System

> **Primary Directive:** Maintain connection between work and meaning.
>
> **Meta-Rule:** "Who benefits from this, and do I believe that?"
>
> **Key Patterns:**
> - Engagement is sustained by perceived impact, not by progress metrics
> - Works best in dialogue — thinking happens in conversation, not isolation
> - Context-switching is cheap when the new context has relational continuity (same team, same mission)
>
> **What this meant in practice:** Solo deep-work blocks were replaced with collaborative sessions. Tools were chosen for their ability to maintain shared context across a team, not individual productivity. The metric shifted from "tasks completed" to "decisions made together that stuck."

## Voice Rules for Codex

When writing user-facing copy in this app, follow these rules:

1. **Direct but warm.** Say what you mean without hedging, but leave space for the reader to disagree.
2. **Short sentences that land, longer ones when the idea needs room.** Vary rhythm.
3. **Concrete over abstract.** Don't say "cognitive patterns affect tool adoption." Say "the reason that task list never worked for you isn't discipline — it's that your brain detects momentum, not completion."
4. **No jargon without grounding.** If you use a term like "cognitive architecture," immediately show what it means in practice.
5. **Second person.** Talk to the reader. "You" not "users" or "one."
6. **Permission-giving, not prescriptive.** "You might find..." not "You should..." This touches identity — be careful with it.
7. **No exclamation marks.** Ever. Calm authority, not enthusiasm.
8. **Specific > vague.** "30 minutes of recovery" beats "significant friction."
